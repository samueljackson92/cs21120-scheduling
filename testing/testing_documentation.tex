\section{Testing the Schedulers}
This document outlines the testing used with the scheduling algorithms in this assignment to ensure correct performance. To test the scheduler implementations a set of JUnit tests have been created and are available in a separate package called "Tests" located with the sources code. The rest of this document provides evidence of carrying out these tests on the algorithms.1
